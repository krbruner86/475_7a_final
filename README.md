# OpenCL / OpenGL Particle System
## CS 475 -- Parallel Programming - Final Project

A real-time particle simulator testing the performance in relation to time and the total number of particles.

All the particles start out white and changes to the color of the sphere it impacts. If a particle impacts both spheres, it will then turn a magenta color.
